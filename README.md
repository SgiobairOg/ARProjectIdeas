# AR Project Ideas

List of ideas for AR projects that I'll forget any other way.

## Linguistic Lizard

Using Unity and environment mapping with point coulds I want to be able to go into a room in my house, set a reference check-in and then tag items in the house with their English name. Once the tags are set I can select a new language and the tags will be translated. This way I can go through the house, look at my window and see `fenster`, for example. May even be able to apply metadata to the objects so that phrases can be added realted to what you're looking at such as `'S e fosgailte a tha an doras` when looking at an open door.

## Navigable Nautilus

Combine bridge monitoring information, AIS, and other instrumentation data to provide a bridge watchstander with all of the information they need to safely navigate without having to take their eyes away from the windows nearly as frequently. Watchstanders will be able to see other ships through their blind spots, see ships at night, and have approaching ships hightlightes over their surroundings.

## Sailing Seagull

AIS Overlay for OP Sail parade with AR Monitor and Merrimack leading the parade.
